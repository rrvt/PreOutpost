PreOutpost Installation Files
BobK6RWY -- eMail Address: rrvt@swde.com

This zip file contains two installation files:

         - PreOWin7
         - PreOWin2000

The Win7 version will run on Win 7 and hopefully later version of Windows.  The Win2000 version runs on
Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  They are built on the save set of files with small modifications to account
for the older operating system libraries.

The pdf file PreOutpost.pdf contains the contents of the help file.

What is PreOutpost?

PreOutpost provides a way to initialize Outpost with 6 different profiles, one for each of the six known
BBS in the Santa Clara Valley.  The profiles are produced from a master profile that must be created
during the first startup or by starting from the Command Line (see pdf file for details).  After one or
more master files have been produced, PreOutpost will start Outpost with a profile for each BBS.

# PreOutpost
Supplies profiles for all BBSes among other services.  With a selection from a toolbar dropdown list and
a twist of a knob on the radio the user may change BBSes.  A Subject Line may be produced and sent to the
clipboard for subsequent pasting into a subject line or other location in a form.  The complete personal
and tactical information may be entered once and sent to all BBS profiles with this program.

The complete address book is displayed in a sister window (note scrolling may be necessary).  The address
name and text that the name represents is shown.  Additional addresses may be created.  The PDF files that
describe where messages should be sent is available from one of the menu items (Routing) and a pdf Routing
Slip is also available.

## Getting Started

The Windows PreOUnit7Installer.msi file will install the program.  PreOutpost must know where Outpost is
located and if there are two versions on your system it will allow you to choose which to use.

A help file is included.  Let the author know if the help file needs improving...

## Built With

Slickedit is used for all edits, Visual Studio 2017 with various additions (Wix being one) is used to
build and debug.  The old fashion Help Workshop is used to compile the help file and an old copy of
Dreamweaver is used to construct the html files used in the Help Workshop.

This work originally supported Win2K, WinXp, Win7 Ansi and Unicode.  The Outpost authors have announced
that they will no longer support operating systems older than Win7.  For a variety of reasons have stop
supporting the Ansi character set and thus the current version is written using the Unicode character
set.

My current operating system is Windows 7 and I have little interest in moving to Windows 10 until it
appears to be stable.  In April 2020 it does not appear stable.

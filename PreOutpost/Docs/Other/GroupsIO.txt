PreOutpost when invoked creates a profile for each BBS with the same identity and report data. When a form is used there are to addresses involved. The address in the form (i.e. To, Loc) and the address that outpost uses. OPaddress has been added to link/show these addresses in one record. Furthermore, OPaddress adds the record to the Outpost address book. One little detail though is different. The Outpost address book has an "Org" field while the forms have a "Loc" field. They are treated as the same. Furthermore, since there may be two "To" fields that contain the same title/name, the Outpost address files contain the "To" field and"Loc" field separated by a dot as the name of the file. Select an OPaddress record and Right mouse to show a short dialog box. Select one of the commands to copy one field of the record to the scratch pad. There are also shortcut keys that do the same thing. As an option, PreOutpost may start OPaddress and shut it down when Outpost shuts down.  OPaddress now includes the two pdf files that help with routing.  They are available as a menu item. There are two installers, one for Win 7 and above and one for Win XP. They are in the Release directory. The files were compiled with Visual Studio 2017. The files were edited with Slickedit 2018.  The latest Windows 7 version are built using Unicode.  The Windows XP version still uses Ansi characters.

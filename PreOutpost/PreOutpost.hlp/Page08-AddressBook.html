<h2>Address Book</h2>
<table class="image" align="right">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="Images/AddressBook03.jpg" width="766"></td></tr>
	<tr>
	  <td class="caption">
    Select address record and use right mouse popup menu to copy field of interest to scratch pad.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  When forms are sent by Outpost the "To" field and "Loc" field describe the
  recipient of the form but do not describe the actual packet address.  The actual
  packet address is added after the browser sends the form to Outpost.  Fortunately
  the log contains both addresses in a convenient manner to capture them together.
</p>
<p>
    The OPaddress application may be started (as an option) by PreOutpost, cobbles up
  the address records held by Outpost and presents them in an independent window.
  Furthermore, when the refresh menu item on the window is selected (left mouse click)
  OPaddress will capture any new form addresses in the current day's log and present
  them.
</p>
<p>
    Each entry presents the "virtual" address (the address in a form), the
  "location/organization" and the "actual" address for each entry.  Each entry takes one line.
  The dialog box may be resized and moved as needed by the user.  The position and size
  are remembered from on instantiation to the next.
</p>
<p>
  Using and entry may be done by copying one of the three fields into the scratch pad using
  the right mouse menu or one of three control characters (keyboard shortcuts).  First select
  the line (Address Record) of interest and then either press the right mouse button or use
  one of keyboard shortcuts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ctrl+C -- Copy Actual Address</li>
  <li>Ctrl+B -- Copy Virtual Address</li>
  <li>Ctrl+L -- Copy Location/Organization</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Then select the field in the browser or Outpost where the item should be placed and use
  the shortcut Ctrl_V or Paste on the right mouse button popup menu.
</p>

<h3>Creating/Editing/Deleting New Addresses</h3>
<p>
  The toolbar (<img src="Images/Toolbar.jpg" width="548" height="33">) includes the commnds: </p> 
<ul>
  <li>Create (envelope icon) -- Create a new Address entry</li>
  <li>Edit (pencil icon) -- Allow editing or deleting the currently selected address entry</li>
  <li>Refresh (dueling arrows icon) -- Refresh the list of addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Since OPaddress may affect entries already created in Outpost saving the new entries
  (or modified entries) is deferred.  While the application is running all entries that appear
  are held in the application.  No changes, additions or deletions in the Outpost files
  are performed until the SaveAll (floppy disk icon) menu item is selected.  Alternatively, when the application
  is closed a prompt to save the entries will be displayed before exiting.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
Several pdf documents may be useful when operating a packet station.  The Packet Docs drop down list 
contains the following pdf files in the menu (The documents are updated from time to time):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Message Handling</li>
<li>Packet Frequencies</li>
<li>Form Routing</li>
<li>Routing Slip</li>
<li>Packet Subject Line</li>
<li>Check In/Out</li>
</ul>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p>
There are three options (rarely used commands) available on the toolbar and the menu.  They are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Find PDF Reader -- There may be more than one pdf reader.  A dialog box pops up to request 
the app name for the pdf reader then the user must select the reader that works well with Outpost 
Address Book app (may take several tries).</li>
<li>Find PDF Files -- Refresh the pdf list in the initialization file (Useful only after 
installing a new version).</li>
<li>Set Drill Traffic -- Load the Clip Board with "**** This is drill traffic ****"</li>
</ul>

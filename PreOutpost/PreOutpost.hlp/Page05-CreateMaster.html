<p>
  Creating a Master Profile is more difficult than using PreOutpost to collect identity and report information.  This is deliberate.  The whole point of PreOutpost is to preserve a profile that works.
</p>
  
  <p>
  The first step is to enter Outpost  and create a working profile for the modem/radio configuration.  Test it thoroughly with one of the BBSes (it doesn’t matter which).  Be sure to name the profile with some identifier that indicates the modem/radio combination.  Keep the name short (I’ve noticed that on some laptops the Profile name edit box is short). Exit Outpost.
</p>
  
  <p>
  Then start a DOS box  in your computer (In Task Bar Search box search for Command Prompt).  Change directory to the directory in which PreOutpost.exe is located, “C:\Program&nbsp;Files&nbsp;(x86)\PreOutpost\”.  In later version I've include a change to the system path variable to include
  the PreOutpost directory.  If the change was successful on your computer then just typing PreOutpost
 at the prompt should yield a help output.  If the help output appears then one can proceed  use the 
 command line switch as described below.
  </p>

  <table class="image" align="right">
  <tr><td><img src="Images/CreateMaster.jpg" width="350"></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="caption">Fig. 7 -- Create a New Master, Delete an Existing Master or Abort</td></tr>
  </table>
  
<p>
  In the DOS Box start PreOutpost with the parameter “/MakeMaster” (see Figure 6).  At that point a dialog box will appear that will give the user one of three options:  Create a new Master Profile, Delete an existing Master profile or Cancelling the operation (see Figure 7).
</p>
  <p>
  There is one special case for creating a Master Profile.  If there are no Master Profiles present then PreOutpost starts the Make Master process.

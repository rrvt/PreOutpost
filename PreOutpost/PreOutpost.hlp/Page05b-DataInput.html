    <h2>FCC Credentials</h2>
    <table width="700" align="right" class="image">
    <tr><td><img src="Images/FCCOnly04.jpg" width="700" alt="FCC Only"></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="caption">Fig. 5 -- Legal (FCC) and Tactical Identification and Report Settings Dialog Box, Tactical Greyed Out</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
    The FCC Credentials are the FCC call sign, the user's name, a three letter prefix used in
    numbering messages and a signature that is placed in plain text messages.
    The Tactical Credentials include the same information, Tactical call sign, user's name, three
    letter prefix and a signature.
    
    </p>
    <p>
    When the FCC credentials only are to be used in Outpost the Press for Tactical Call Sign check box is left unchecked.  This causes the tactical
    credentials to be unavailable for change. 
    Using the mouse to "select" the check box will install a check mark in the box and also allow modification of the Tactical credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
		The ICS Report use two of the Report variables, the Task ID and the Task Name in the header of the report.  Choose something appropriate for those values.  
    At the time of this writing the use of the Other Report Variables is unknown.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Finding Credentials Prepared in the Past</h2>
    <p>
    The Credentials are saved in files that are identified by type and the Call Sign.  PreOutpost will find and display the credentials if they exist by merely
    inserting the call sign into the appropriate call sign edit box and leaving the edit box.  Then the credentials found (if any) may be modified or left as they 
    are.  There is one slight problem with this scheme.  If the user modifies the &quot;User Name&quot; or the &quot;Additional ID Text&quot; 
    for the Tactical credentials (for example) then the 
    search feature is for those credentials is shut down.  This is because you went to all the trouble to change something, the search feature would override it if
    something was found.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In the event that nothing is found during the search, the current content of the edit boxes is unchanged.  All the non-greyed fields may be modified
      while the dialog box is present on the screen.  The entire content of the dialog box is saved appropriately so that it appears the next time PreOutpost is
      invoked and so that the searches for the credentials will succeed the next time.  Furthermore, Outpost will be started with the values found in the dialog
      box when OK is pressed.
    </p>

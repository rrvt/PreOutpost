<h1>Outpost Address Book App</h1>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Outpost utilizes an Address Book which is accessed by selecting the To: button and selecting a virtual address.
In Outpost one can create and edit addresses so that a virtual address translate to one or more real addresses.  However,
one can only view eight virtual addresses at a time (scrolling down to view more) and must select an address to see what the
actual addresses are.
</p>
<p>
The app may be started independently with or without Outpost or if one use PreOutpost to setup several profiles, preOutpost
starts the Outpost Address Book App and Outpost at the same time.  When Outpost is closed, the Outpost Address Book App is
also closed.  I find using a quarter of the screen for this app allows me to see the useful addresses while operating.
</p>
<p>
This app provides a way to view more addresses and to also see the actual addresses for each virtual address displayed.
While it provides a way to create, edit and delete address records it only provides one line per virtual address/actual addresses on the main window.  In addition one can copy the virtual and actual addresses to the clipboard for one of the
highlighted lines.
</p>
<p>
Documentation for outpost keeps changing.  So this app includes five pdf files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SCCo-packet-freqs</li>
<li>SCCo_RACES_Rec_Form_Routing</li>
<li>SCCo_Std_Fmt_Pkt_Subj_Line</li>
<li>SCCo_Std_Packet_Check-In-Out</li>
<li>XSC_RACES_Routing_Slip_Fillable</li>
</ul>
<p>They may be viewed by selecting the particular item in a drop down list on the toolbar.  The local pdf reader is
sent the file selected.  This requires the app know where the local pdf reader is located (its path) and if the 
pdf files change a way to know the path to the files.
</p>
<p>
There are commands to find a suitable pdf reader and another to identify the pdf file in the Program/PreOutpost directory.
</p>
<p>
The last feature is the best:  There is a command to place the following string in the clipboard: "*** This is drill traffic ***". Of course this is only useful during the weekly check-ins.

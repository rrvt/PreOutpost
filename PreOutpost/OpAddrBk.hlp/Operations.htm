<h1>Outpost Address Book Operations</h1>

<h2>Main Window</h2>
<p>
The main window has several components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A Menu Bar</li>
<li>A Tool Bar</li>
<li>A Heading for the List of Addresses</li>
<li>A List Box (with optional vertical scroll bar)</li>
<li>Status Bar at the bottom Left hand side of Main Window</li>
</ul>
<p>
The main window will remember where it was last located on the screen and it may be moved by grabing
the Window's Title Bar and dragging.  Furthermore it will remember the width and height of the window.
The width and height may be changed by grabbing any of the edges and dragging.
</p>
<p>
The Status Bar, when it is useful, will show something about the current command.
</p>

<h2>Main Window ToolBar Operations</h2>
<p>
Most of the operations may be invoked from the toolbar.  There is a menu too which includes this help
file.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/NewAddr.jpg" width="32" height="30"> Create a New Address</h3>
<p>
Opens the Address Form dialog box set up to input a new Outpost Address.  The dialog box is discussed
in detail below.  But as a new address, one cannot input a Virtual Name (labelled "Name") which is the
same as an existing address.  If one needs to change an existing address use the Edit command.  Note
the Delete Button is disabled when inputing a new address.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/EditAddr.jpg" width="32" height="30"> Edit Address</h3>
<p>
Opens the Address Form dialog box with the address data that is high lighted set up to edit the address
details.  The dialog box is discussed in detail below.  Please note that the Virtual Name (labelled "Name") may be changed but the file containing the original named address will be deleted and another
file created.  If the name is not changed then the details changed will be written to the file either
when "Save All" or "Exit" commands is selected.
</p>


<h3><img src="Images/Refresh.jpg" width="32" height="30"> Refresh </h3>
<p>
Att this time this command is not documented.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/PacketDocs.jpg" width="185" height="30"> Packet Docs</h3>
<p>
Click anywhere in this button/drop down list and a drop down list with five documents listed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Packet Frequencies</li>
<li>Form Routing</li>
<li>Packet Subject Line</li>
<li>Check In/Out</li>
<li>Routing Slip</li>
</ul>
<p>
Selecting (Clicking) on one of the titles will cause the PDF reader of your choice to show the content
of the pdf file.  The PDF reader will be operating stand alone so the user will need to minimize or
close it to recover the screen space it uses.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/Options.jpg" width="171" height="30"> Options</h3>
<p>
This is a drop down list of some seldom used commands:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Find PDF Reader</li>
<li>Find PDF Files</li>
<li>Set Drill Traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>
Find PDF Reader opens a dialog box.  There are several PDF readers in the world.  The user must supply
the executable name (or names separated by spaces) in the edit box of the dialog box and press the "Find Paths" button (or just hit the return key).  After some time one or more paths to the executable name will appear in the list box.
</p>
<p>
The problem, I found, is that not all executables will accept a file name when started.  So the next
step is to test each executable by double clicking on each path in the list box.  The Status Box at the
bottom of the main window of the App will show the path when the test starts.  If a file is opened in
the PDF reader the test was a success.  When the PDF reader is closed the Status Box wil show "Testing
Complete".  If the Status Box shows "Testing Complete without a PDF reader opening the test has failed.
Once a viable reader has been found selecting the button "PDF App Found" will store the path away for
future use.
</p>
<p>
The "Find PDF Files" command attempts to find all the pdf files stored in the Program Directory.  They
do this by searching the pdf files that match specific patterns in their file names.  The file names
only need to contain the patterns, they do not need to exactly match the pattern.  Here are the
patterns:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"packet-freqs"</li>
<li>"Form_Routing"</li>
<li>"Subj_Line"</li>
<li>"Check-In"</li>
<li>"Routing_Slip"</li>
</ul>
<p>
So the obvious caution is that before changing the files in the Program Directory be sure that
the patterns exist in the file names.
</p>
<p>
The last option is to "Set Drill Traffic".  It only puts the string "**** This is drill traffic ****"
into the clipboard making it available for pasting into another document or App.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/SaveAddr.jpg" width="32" height="30"> Save All Modified Addresses</h3>
<p>
This command saves the modified files, delete the files marked for deletion and creates new files
when they have been created in the App.  It does nothing with address that have not been modified,
created or deleted.
</p>

<h3><img src="Images/About.jpg" width="16" height="15"> About</h3>
<p>
Displays the About Box.
</p>
<h3><img src="Images/Exit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Exit</h3>
<p>
If any addresses have been modified, created or deleted a dialog box will appear asking if
the address should be saved.  The save operation is the same as the "Save All Modified Addresses"
command.
Then the application exits. </p>

<h2>Main Window High Lighted line Right Mouse Button Menu and Hot Keys</h2>
<p>
The List Box on the Main Window contains lines which show each Virtual Address and Actual Address
for each Address Record in Outpost. Using the Left Mouse Button to high light an Address represented
by a line.  Then there are four commands that may be executed by selecting the command on a Right
Mouse button popup menu.  The four commands may also be executed by using the corresponding Control +
key (a hot key).  Here are the four commands given in the Right Mouse popup menu:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy Virtual Address&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+B</li>
<li>Copy Organization&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+O</li>
<li>Copy Actual Addr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+C</li>
<li>Edit Address&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl+E</li>
</ul>

<h2>Address Detail Dialog Box</h2>
<p>
There are several ways this dialog box is invoked.  It allows one to create a new address, edit
an existing address or delete an existing address.  However, all the operations performed in this dialog
box only change data within the App until either the "Save All" or "Exit" commands in the App are
executed.  Exiting the App via the 'X' in the upper right hand corner will cause all the changes to be
forgotten.
</p>
